# Cumulocity Streaming Analytics (Apama) development container

## Overview
This repository specifies a [development container](https://containers.dev/overview), suitable for use for standard Apama development, or for working with the [Block SDK](https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/apama-analytics-builder-block-sdk) & [EPL Apps Tools](https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/apama-eplapps-tools).

## Instructions
To use this, you can can either fork this repository, or copy the `.devcontainer` directory into your existing project. Use your DevContainer tool of choice (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)) to run this.

### Before you build
Before you build the devcontainer, you might want to adjust some of the values within `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

| APAMA_VERSION                         | the tag of the Apama base container                       | Please see [Amazon ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/apama/apama-builder) for available versions.  |
| APAMA_ANALYTICS_BUILDER_SDK_BRANCH    | the branch/version of the Analytics Builder SDK           | Please see [Github](https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/apama-analytics-builder-block-sdk) for the available branches  |
| APAMA_EPLAPPS_TOOLS_BRANCH            | the branch/version of the EPL Apps Tools SDK              | Please see [Github](https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/apama-eplapps-tools) for the available branches  |

__*Note:*__ The Analytics Builder SDK needs to be in the same version as the Apama in the Cloud when you want to deploy. 

## Using Block SDK & EPLApps Tools
The Block SDK & EPLApps Tools are checked out as siblings to your current workspace folder. This allows you to easily add bundles from either of those projects using `apama_project` (which is accessible from the VSCode extension), or to simply use the, or to simply use them.

### Block SDK cloud operations
For commands in the Block SDK that require Cloud access, such as "upload", we recommend using a `.env` file.

1. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
2. Create a `.env` file with the following format.

```
CUMULOCITY_SERVER_URL=<URL>
CUMULOCITY_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
CUMULOCITY_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
```

Replacing `<URL>`, `<USERNAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` with the correct values.

3. When you need to perform a Block SDK operation, run `source .env` within your terminal. This will create a terminal instance with the relevant environment variables for authenticating to Cumulocity.


## Usage notes
- You may find the default memory allocated by your containerization tool is not sufficient. We advise having a minimum of 4GB of memory for local development.
